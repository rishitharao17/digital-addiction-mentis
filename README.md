📌 Problem Statement
Non-AI digital tools for managing digital addiction in adolescents.

📖 Problem Description
Adolescents today spend excessive time on mobile phones, especially on entertainment apps like YouTube and games.
Existing tools mostly show screen-time statistics or warnings, which users often ignore.
There is a need for a mandatory system that actively interrupts overuse and enforces healthy breaks.

💡 Proposed Solution
We developed a non-AI, rule-based digital addiction management tool that actively controls screen usage instead of only tracking it.
The system:
Monitors screen time
Detects overuse
Triggers mandatory alerts
Forces break time with app blocking
Encourages healthy activities during breaks

This solution does not use Artificial Intelligence and works on simple time-based rules.

⚙️ How It Works

The system continuously monitors total screen usage and app-wise usage (especially YouTube and games).

If the user uses the phone continuously for 30 minutes, overuse behavior is detected.

When total screen time reaches 60 minutes, a full-screen mandatory alert appears.

The alert displays the message:
“You have been using your phone for 60 minutes. Take a break now.”

The alert cannot be skipped or closed once enabled.

After the alert, a temporary lock mode is activated, blocking distracting apps.

During the break period, the user is guided with:

Meditation and breathing exercises

Light physical exercises


After the break timer ends, controlled phone usage is restored.

🚀 Features
Screen time monitoring
App-wise overuse detection
Mandatory full-screen alerts
Temporary app blocking
Forced break timer
Healthy break activity suggestions
Simple and user-friendly interface

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS
Logic: JavaScript (rule-based)
Prototype Type: Web-based simulation

Note: For real-world deployment, this logic can be integrated with Android Digital Wellbeing and Accessibility APIs.


🌟 Innovation
Most existing apps only track screen time.
Our solution actively stops digital addiction by enforcing mandatory alerts and breaks, making it a proactive digital well-being tool.

📈 Impact


Reduces excessive screen usage


Improves focus and sleep habits


Encourages healthier digital behavior among adolescents



🏁 Conclusion
As first-year students, Team Neural Forge built a simple yet effective non-AI digital solution that actively manages digital addiction through mandatory intervention rather than passive monitoring.

🔥 Final Note

“Our solution doesn’t just track screen time — it actively stops overuse.”
